The goal is simple: Improve business relationships. A CRM system helps companies stay connected to customers, streamline processes, and improve profitability. (from salesforce.com)

Our product CandHCRM delivers a 100%-free solution as a web application. It supports a variety of functionalities, e.g. contact management, mass mailing, online chat, voice/video call, screen share, meeting scheduling, and real-time notification. 

The backend server uses Spring Boot framework and provides restful API service that the React frontend uses. The database used is MongoDB. The project is deployed to two Heroku apps from a multi-language monorepo. With the secret key HEROKU_API_KEY set in our GitHub reposiotry, the file `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs automatic deployment to Heroku once there's a push in main.

Heroku URL: https://crm-c-and-h.herokuapp.com/.
